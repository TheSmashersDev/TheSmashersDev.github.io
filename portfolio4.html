<b>Development timeline:</b><br>
I started the project on Scratch at the beginning of my junior year of high school. That was where I made the code for rendering points on the screen. Eventually, I taught myself the graphics portion of Java and was able to convert all my code from scratch to Java (except keyboard input, which came much later).<br>

After that, I spent most of my time and effort working on the world generation and adding elements to the engine like a very basic shader model for fog and moving waves in water and culling. <br>

The world generation was took the largest amount of time, my process had multiple impulse points around the map that would create hills and bumps in the terrain.<br><br>

<b>Development focus:</b><br>

During my junior and senior year of high school, I had a specific fascination with the basics of 3D engines and minecraft-esque open-world generation. I wanted to make my own 3D engine with as little code implemented from outside sources as possible. I created the rendering engine and scripts myself (the main script being taking in the x,y,z position of a point and returning the x and y positions of those points on the screen based on the position and rotation of the camera).<br>

After that, I started working on the world generation. I made a very very simplistic noise generation process which was able to make the world generation smooth.<br>
