My name is Jackson Clayton. I’ve been making games since the fourth grade. I’m obsessed with 3D engines and level design. I design games that people  indirectly teach the player a skill and test them on it throughout the game all using level design.

Modder at Heart
</h1>
I started game development and level design through mod-tools. I have experience with the hammer editor in both Quake 1 and Counter Strike Global Offensive.<br>
I worked on an overhaul mod of the Quake mod NZP in the FTE source port of Quake 1.

I put a lot of effort into making and editing quality trailers for my newly released games. Making trailers is one of my favorite parts of releasing a game. I will spend hours recording clips to use, and then run dozens of iterations by friends until I can get the best flowing trailer. Watching the playlist you can see my skills have gone up drastically over time. I have recently improved with pacing and getting better at syncing clips with the trailer music.
